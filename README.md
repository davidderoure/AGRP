# AGRP
Audio Gesture Recognition Prototype

Prototype code to run in the browser and analyse incoming MIDI stream for gestures according to the spec provided by
George E Lewis to the RNCM PRiSM team.

This is a proof-of-concept demonstrator in preparation for an implementation that takes audio input.

browsertest.{html,js} displays incoming MIDI events on the console

agrp.{html,js} buffers and displays incoming events on a dashboard

agrp is under development and will be extended to classify the contours of gestures
